A website to explain how computers actually work.

Community Call to Action: Wall of NAND
-----------------------------------------
Right now, NAND gates are an abstract topic without a great basis on anything tangiable.
Because of this, the next goal is to build  a collection of various real life implementations of NAND gates, 
so that people can see where in reality they exist. 

The actual specifics and details of such a page are still up for discussion, but my idea for right now is
community submitted videos of NAND gates, all on a seperate paged, linked to by the NAND page. 

The obvious one we need is the electric transistor implementation, but it's important that we show that there are
various implementations of the NAND gate. I've seen them made out of water, you can do it in minecraft (hopefully
there's no copyright on that), I think there's also a implementation using light.

Basically, I want a page that shows all the various ways you could actually go out and build a NAND gate.

I've opened an issue on the topic, as I want peoples feedback.

Anyways, the general guideline for submitting videos will probably be (and keep in mind, this aren't set in stone yet):
 * Keep it short and simple
 * try to mimic the overall colorscheme of the site (huge bonus points if you can do green/red for on/off)
 * make sure theres no copyright, and keep intros, branding, etc. to a minimum (hopefully none).



Coding styles:
--------------

 * js width less then 80 characters.
 * If you have to choose between fast or simple, choose simple.
 * In general, less is more.
